# EnemyGravePreview (v1.0.0) (1.16-1.21.x+)

- This plugin is an unofficial add-on to [AngelChest](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%AD%90-angelchest-plus-%E2%AD%90-death-chests-graveyards.88214/) that allows other players to preview the contents of your grave by interacting with it, while being unable to steal from it.

- Armour and offhand items will always go to the bottom row of the preview.

- If you have any questions or find any bugs, feel free to join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/akbd8EPSgr).
